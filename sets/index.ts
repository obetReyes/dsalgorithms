/* sets diffier in arrays in the way that  values cant be duplicated is perfect for unique values like ids phones numbers and email*/

/* Reading from a set is exactly the same as reading from an array—it takes just
one step for the computer to look up what is contained within a particular
index. As we described earlier, this is because the computer can jump to any
index within the set since it knows the memory address that the set begins at

/* 
Searching a set also turns out to be no different than searching an array—it
takes up to N steps to search to see if a value exists within a set. And deletion
is also identical between a set and an array—it takes up to N steps to delete a
value and move data to the left to close the gap
*/

/* Insertion, however, is where arrays and sets diverge. Let’s first explore
inserting a value at the end of a set, which was a best-case scenario for an
array. With an array, the computer can insert a value at its end in a single step.
With a set, however, the computer first needs to determine that this value
doesn’t already exist in this set—because that’s what sets do: they prevent
duplicate data. So every insert first requires a search.*/

/* The expression "2N + 1" represents a mathematical equation where N is a variable. The equation consists of two parts: "2N" and "+ 1".

The term "2N" denotes multiplying the variable N by 2, and the result of this multiplication represents twice the value of N. */
